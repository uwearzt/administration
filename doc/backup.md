# Backup strategy


## Special programs

### Mail (IMAP)

In theory, because i use hosted IMAP accounts, the provider should run a proper
backup. But because i am scared about losing emails, i also do a daily backup
of all my email accounts.

I use [imap-backup](https://github.com/joeyates/imap-backup) for a daily copy to a local directory,
which is included in the normal backup process.

### Calendar (CalDAV)

### Apple Photos
